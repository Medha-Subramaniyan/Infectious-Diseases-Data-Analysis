# Infectious Diseases Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was developed for Infectious Disease Professionals LLC, a private practice comprised of Georgia's leading infectious disease specialists. The primary goal of this analysis is to provide the practice's medical professionals with detailed insights and trends on five common infectious diseases: LaCrosse Disease, Lyme Disease, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Tuberculosis, and Hepatitis C. This analysis spans from data cleaning to advanced visualizations, highlighting patterns and trends that are critical for public health surveillance and decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Used for data cleaning and manipulations, with libraries such as Pandas for data frame operations and Matplotlib for creating preliminary visualizations.
- **SQL:** Used for querying and managing data, ensuring accurate and efficient data retrieval.
- **Tableau:** Employed for generating comprehensive and interactive visualizations to depict disease trends effectively.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive coding sessions and presenting the data cleaning and visualization processes.

## Key Visualizations
- **Hepatitis C Death Counts and Rate:** Illustrates the mortality rates and counts from Hepatitis C across various states.
